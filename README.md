Interactive dashboards using flexdashboard and shiny

This is an online repository of codes and datasets for sample dynamic dashboards. I did this for an R Markdown training that my work colleagues and I conducted in February 2021. 

*Saudi Arabia's 2015-2019 Trade Dashboard*

I made an interactive dashboard out of Saudi Arabia's UN Comtrade data for 2015-2019. I have uploaded the final script and the dashboard can be viewed online here: https://gelijuani.shinyapps.io/sa_comtrade/ 

*Credit Card Customers Data Dashboard*

I also made an interactive dashboard out of credit card customers' data. 
This was inspired by this article (https://towardsdatascience.com/create-an-interactive-dashboard-with-shiny-flexdashboard-and-plotly-b1f025aebc9c) and I just added a second page to make an interactive data table that the users can download. The dataset is from Kaggle.
